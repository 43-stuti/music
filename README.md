Each raga is to be sung or played at a specific hour of the day or a pericular season to experience it in the proper mood and setting(A more detailed information [here](https://scroll.in/magazine/842228/when-and-how-did-hindustani-ragas-become-ascribed-to-different-times-of-the-day)). 
I wanted to created a player that detects the time and weather conditions and plays the specified raga. Running into a few implementation challenges with it. I instead decided to created a music intrument, that lets the user play with  notes and discover Indian ragas along the way.
While making note selections the system recommeneds the closest ragas with a similar arrangement as chosen by the user.

While playing a particular Raga, the system find a place that would have the same time as that suitable for the Raga and transports the user to that place, PS: Due to logistical challenges this transportation is made possible only via google maps
